# BUILD FACTS TO VERIFY — Southern Suburbs Builders Website Template

**Purpose:** Commerce copy in this folder was written from the product brief and the Westlake-style release pattern **before** Claude’s final build summary.  
**Rule:** Do **not** state a feature exists in public Etsy/portfolio copy until it is checked off here against the finished site + package.

**Owner after build:** Release / packaging agent or human reviewer  
**Commerce author:** Grok (`agent/grok-commerce`)  
**Last commerce draft:** 2026-07-13  

---

## How to use

1. Claude (or builder) finishes the commercial template.  
2. Reviewer opens the live demo + buyer ZIP.  
3. For each row: mark **PASS**, **FAIL**, or **N/A**, and note the evidence (file path / screenshot / commit).  
4. Update `etsy-listing-copy.md` / social pack to remove `VERIFY_AFTER_BUILD` only for PASS items.  
5. FAIL items must be removed from listing claims or fixed in code before draft publish.
